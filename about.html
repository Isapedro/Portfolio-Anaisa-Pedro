    <h2 class="mb-4">Front-end developer from Portugal, based in Germany.</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Anaisa but everyone calls me by Isa and I am 31 years old. Most
      of my life I have been in the hospitality sector, but in my
      head I have always been super interested in how people work with computers since
      I didn't own one for several years. This year I decided to start a new challenge and try to change my
      career path. So I invested first in a computer and then an online course
      where I found SheCodes was definitly the best out there teaching absolute beginners. 
      I have been super keen in learning and developing my skills
      while working full time in a family own busines , devoting everyday 5
      hours to this course so I could start this new career path as soon as
      possible. 
      I am a person who works very well with a team or by myself, fast
      learner, good organization skills and great work ethic because I always
      commit 100% in new professional challenges. 
      I am a person that very easely integrates to new situations and work enviroments. 
      The several work sceneries I have had is what has helped me acquire all this qualities.
