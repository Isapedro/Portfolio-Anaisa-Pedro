    <p>
      My name is Anaisa but I go by Isa to make everyone's life easier. I'm 31 and I love music, dancing, travelling, and meeting new people. I have lived in four countries so far and have just moved to Munich for the "chapter 2024". 

For most of my life, I have been working in the hospitality sector, but I have always been fascinated by how people work with computers, especially since I didn't own one for several years. This year, I decided to start a new challenge and change my career path. So, I invested in a MacBook Air and after some searching, I found SheCodes Workshops, which found to be very helpful and explanatory for teaching absolute beginners. 


During the workshops, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages using VS Code and Sandbox. I also open-sourced my projects on GitHub and Hosting them, using the Bootstrap framework and React.js library. On my projects page, I showcase two projects that utilize React.

Currently, I am further improving my skills by taking freeCodeCamp courses, practising on the SoloLearn app, following tutorials from YouTube, and creating my own little projects


I am a person who works very well with a team or by myself, a fast learner, with good organizational skills, and a great work ethic. I always commit 100% to new professional challenges. I easily integrate into new situations and work environments, which I have acquired through my several work experiences.
